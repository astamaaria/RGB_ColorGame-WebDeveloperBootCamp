# The Web Developer Bootcamp

This repository contains the projects that I made during Colt Steele's Developer Bootcamp (https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).

The Yelp-Camp project, is a camping site, where users can create, edit and remove own campgrounds and leave comments on other persons' campgrounds.

The other project is a RGB-color guessing game. It utilizes CSS, HTML and DOM.
