#RGB-game

This was the first project on  Web Developer Bootcamp course which I really liked and was very happy with result: how it turned out stylewise and how the functionalities played out. Earlier projects were quite ugly so it was a pleasure to produce something nicelooking. 

The project utilizes CSS, HTML, JS and DOM.
