# RGB-game

From December 2017 to February 2018 I studied on Colt Steele's online course: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">The Web Developer Bootcamp</a> which was the best online course I have ever studied on. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript but I also got instructed about Express and Node.js.
This RGB-game was the first project on  Web Developer Bootcamp course which I really liked and was very happy how it turned out stylewise and how the functionalities played out. My first projects were quite ugly so it was a pleasure to produce something nice-looking. 

The project utilizes CSS, HTML, JS and DOM.
