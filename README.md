# RGB-game

This repository contains my projects from Colt Steele's <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">The Web Developer Bootcamp online course </a>. In this branch resides a simple RGB-color guessing game and in the <a href="https://github.com/astamaaria/theWebDeveloperBootcamp/tree/yelp_camp"><strong> yelp_camp branch</strong></a> an Express-app.

This RGB-game was the first project on  Web Developer Bootcamp course which I really liked and was very happy with result: how it turned out stylewise and how the functionalities played out. My first projects were quite ugly so it was a pleasure to produce something nice-looking. 

The project utilizes CSS, HTML, JS and DOM.
